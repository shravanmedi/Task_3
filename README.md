SQL for Data Analysis (Using Sakila Database)
Dataset
Official MySQL Sample: Sakila Contains data about a fictional DVD rental store, including tables such as: customer, film, rental, inventory, payment, staff, etc.

What I Did
I performed SQL operations covering:

1. Basic SQL Queries
Selected customer records by city. Listed the top 10 most rented films.

2. JOINS
Joined tables to view customer rental histories. Used LEFT JOIN to show customers with or without rentals.

3. Subqueries
Found customers who rented more films than the average.


4. Views
Created a view for the top 5 most rented films.

5. Optimization
Added an index to improve filtering on rental dates.

Screenshots
All query results and outputs are available in the screenshots/ folder.
